 *  Data type for manipulating individual pixels of an image. The original
 *  image can be read from a file in jpg, gif, or png format, or the
 *  user can create a blank image of a given dimension. Includes methods for
 *  displaying the image in a window on the screen or saving to a file.
 *
 *  Remarks
 *   - pixel (x, y) is column x and row y, where (0, 0) is upper left

 *  The iron-puzzle.png image is a puzzle; it contains an image of something famous,
 *  however the image has been distorted. The famous object is in the red values, 
 *  however the red values have all been divided by 10, so they are too small by a 
 *  factor of 10. The blue and green values are all just meaningless random values
 *  ("noise") added to obscure the real image. You must undo these distortions to 
 *  reveal the real image. First, set all the blue and green values to 0 to get them
 *  out of the way. Look at the result .. if you look very carefully, you may see
 *  the real image, although it is very very dark (way down towards 0). Then multiply
 *  each red value by 10, scaling it back up to approximately its proper value. 
 *  What is the famous object?
